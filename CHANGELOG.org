This document tracks the most important changes of this package
throughout time (in descending chronological order) and in between
releases.

* 1.0.2

- [[user:aerz][Agustín Cisneros]]: Keep track of the active theme as a workaround to
  ignoring unwanted/duplicate signals ([[pull:16][#16]])

* 1.0.1

- Go back to using signals ([[pull:14][#14]])

  [[pull:11][#11]] introduced a change that unintentionally misused a facility from
  the D-Bus protocol to catch specific method calls (but is reserved
  for debugging D-Bus services) emitted by Darkman; this was later
  caught by [[user:aerz][Agustín Cisneros]] in [[pull:13][#13]].

- Discard unnecessary call to ~remove-hook~ when the mode is enabled
- Site-specific configuration files are now loaded via ~load-file~
  instead of ~require~
- [[user:tarsius][Jonas Bernoulli]]: Add =.nosearch= file in =site= directory to avoid
  MELPA from indexing the directory

* 1.0.0

The changes in this tag were made following our [[https://github.com/melpa/melpa/pull/8423][submission for inclusion into MELPA]].

- [[user:riscy][Chris Rayner]]: Do not use ~format~ when parameter is already an ~f-string~
- [[user:progfolio][Nicolas Vollmer]]: Use meaningful and conventional function names and docstrings
- [[user:progfolio][Nicolas Vollmer]]: Avoid the fragile ~called-interactively-p~ function
- [[user:progfolio][Nicolas Vollmer]]: Prefer an ~if~ form in ~darkman-set-mode~
- [[user:progfolio][Nicolas Vollmer]]: Combine ~when~ and ~let*~ forms into ~when-let*~ in
  ~darkman--event-handler~
- [[user:progfolio][Nicolas Vollmer]]: Do not make hooks on behalf of the user
  =server-after-make-frame-hook= as it may be considered impolite

* 0.7.0

- Prefer if form in ~darkman-get~ function
- Fix assignment to free (now obsolete) variable ~darkman--dbus-signal~

* 0.6.0

- Protect the invocation of ~darkman-register-monitor~
- Address linting errors to prepare for the submission of the package to MELPA
